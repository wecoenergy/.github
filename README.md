# Turning waves into Watts!

At Weco, we believe that wave energy will play an important role in achieving a 100% renewable energy supply. The worldwide potential of wave energy is the equivalent of three billion households that can be supplied with electricity! Furthermore, it is a good addition to the existing sources of green energy. Offshore wind farms and wave energy installations can be well combined and a mix of energy sources ensures a more stable energy production.
